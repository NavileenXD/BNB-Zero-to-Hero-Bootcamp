Using your choice of hardhat, foundry or truffle:
1. Create a project for your Badger coin.
2. Write unit tests for your Badger coin contract showing that:
    - The total supply is initially 1000000.
    - That the number of decimals is 18.
    - The balanceOf function returns the correct result.
    - The transfer function works correctly.
    - Test that an error is produced if a transfer is created with an insufficient balance.
