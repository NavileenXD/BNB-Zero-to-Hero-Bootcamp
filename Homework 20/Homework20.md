# Audit

Imagine you have been given the following [code](https://gist.github.com/extropyCoder/348528075d856da66f7cedcc7c48226a) to audit with the following note from the team "PuppyCoinGame is an investment club where investors are added to the contract via the addInvestor function, they need to send 1 ETH to join.

Once 200 players have entered, the UI will be notified by the payDividends event, which will then pick the top investors and pay them some dividends. The remaining balance will be kept as profit for the developers."

Write out the main points that you would include in an audit report.
