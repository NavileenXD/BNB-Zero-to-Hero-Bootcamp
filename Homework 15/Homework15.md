# Badger Coin improvements

Using the Badger Coin you created in previous homeworks:
1. Make sure that the `approve` and `transferFrom` functions are implemented.

2. Add pausable functionality; you can use the OpenZeppelin Pausable contract.

3. Write unit tests to test the above functionality.

4. Deploy you new contract onto the test network.
